# ECLO: Ultima Online Enhanced Client LOader
Cross-platform Ultima Online Enhanced Client patcher.<br>
It's able to patch on-the-fly the client executable and then run it, which works fairly well for servers behind a Dynamic DNS (without a static external IP) and OSes different than Windows.
<br>
Supported patches:
* IP, being also able to resolve a hostname and automatically translate it into an IPv4 address;
* Port;
<br>Compatible with every Enhanced Client version (as of mid 2023...).
