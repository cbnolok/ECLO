# UOEC Autopatcher
Cross-platform Ultima Online Enhanced Client patcher.<br>
It's able to patch on-the-fly the client executable and then run it, which works fairly well for servers behind a Dynamic DNS (without a static external IP).
<br>
Supported patches:
* IP, being also able to resolve a hostname and automatically translate it into an IPv4 address;
* Port;
* Disable encryption.
<br>Compatible with every Enhanced Client version (to this date).
